 ### Project Title: Customer Behavior Analysis
A comprehensive data analysis project that processes customer shopping data, loads it into a SQL Server database, and performs in-depth analysis to uncover business insights. The project demonstrates a full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and analytical capabilities.

 Project Structure & Workflow
The project can be broken down into four main phases:

Data Exploration & Preprocessing (Python/Pandas)

Database Integration (SQL Server)

Data Loading & Validation (Python/SQL)

Business Intelligence & SQL Analysis

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Category	Technologies
Programming Language	Python
Data Manipulation	Pandas, NumPy
Database Connection	pyodbc, SQLAlchemy
Database System	Microsoft SQL Server
Analysis & Querying	SQL
Data Visualization	Microsoft Power BI

üìä Phase 1: Data Preprocessing with Python
This phase focuses on cleaning and preparing the raw data for analysis.

Key Steps:

Data Loading: Loaded the dataset customer_shopping_behavior.csv using pandas.

Data Inspection: Used df.info() and df.describe() to understand the data structure, check for missing values, and get summary statistics.

Handling Missing Values: Identified 37 missing values in the Review Rating column and imputed them with the median rating for each product Category.

Data Cleaning:

Standardized column names to lowercase for consistency.

Detected that the Discount Applied and Promo Code Used columns were identical, so Promo Code Used was dropped to reduce redundancy.

Feature Engineering:

Created an age_group column (Young Adult, Adult, Middle-aged, Senior) using quantile-based binning (pd.qcut).

Created a purchase_frequency_days column by mapping textual frequencies (e.g., 'Weekly', 'Annually') to a numerical value representing the days between purchases.

üóÑÔ∏è Phase 2: Database Integration
This phase involves connecting the Python script to a SQL Server instance to store and manage the data.

Key Components:

Connection Class: A custom SQLServerConnection class was built to handle database interactions.

Authentication: Utilized Windows Authentication for secure database access.

Dual Connection Methods:

SQLAlchemy: Used for its high-level ORM and ease of use with Pandas' to_sql method.

pyodbc: Used as a reliable, low-level fallback method for direct SQL execution, ensuring data could be loaded even if one method failed.

Robust Error Handling: The code includes comprehensive try-except blocks to gracefully handle connection and data loading errors.

üì• Phase 3: Data Loading & Validation
The cleaned DataFrame is loaded into a SQL Server table, with checks to ensure data integrity.

Process:

Primary Method: Attempt to load the data using SQLAlchemy's df.to_sql() method.

Fallback Method: If the primary method fails (e.g., due to data type issues), a fallback function using pyodbc is triggered. This function:

Creates the table with explicitly defined SQL data types.

Uses a cursor to INSERT rows one by one from the DataFrame.

Verification: After loading, a COUNT(*) query is run to verify that all rows were successfully transferred from Python to SQL Server.

üîç Phase 4: SQL Analysis & Business Intelligence
A series of SQL queries were executed to extract meaningful insights from the customer data.

Sample Analysis Questions:

Q1: What is the total revenue generated by male vs. female customers?

Q2: Which customers used a discount but still spent more than the average?

Q3: What are the top 5 products with the highest average review ratings?

Q4: How do average purchase amounts compare between Standard and Express Shipping?

Q5: Do subscribed customers spend more on average?

Q6: Which products have the highest discount application rate?

Q7: Segment customers into New, Returning, and Loyal based on purchase history.

Q8: What are the top 3 most purchased products in each category?

Q9: Are repeat buyers more likely to subscribe?

Q10: What is the revenue contribution of each age group?

üìà Results & Visualization
The final part of the PDF shows a Customer Behavior Dashboard, visualizing key metrics like:

Number of Customers

Average Purchase Amount

Average Review Rating

Revenue and Sales breakdowns by Category, Age Group, and Subscription Status.

This indicates the project's output was used to create a business intelligence dashboard (likely in tools like Power BI, Tableau, or similar).

üí° How to Run This Project
Prerequisites:

Python 3.x with pandas, pyodbc, sqlalchemy installed.

A running instance of Microsoft SQL Server.

Setup:

Update the server name in the SQLServerConnection initialization to match your SQL Server instance (e.g., DESKTOP-DMP3770).

Ensure the database (default is master) is accessible.

Execution:

Run the script. It will test the connection, preprocess the data, load it into SQL Server, and run the sample analysis queries.****
